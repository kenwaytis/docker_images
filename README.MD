# Project Description
## compreface
[Compreface github](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace)
Open-source facial detection service that provides API interfaces within a container. To use this service, you will need the corresponding language SDK and an API key for accessing the service.
## deeplx
[DeeplX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX)
DeepL provides an API interface for local deployment, but it seems that the service still relies on DeepL servers. While it can be used, it may have slow response times for a large number of requests.
## dev-containers
The base image used for personal development purposes. The initial version of the Dockerfile has been lost, and what remains now are the updated files. Ubuntu with Python 3.8 is being used.
## fast_whisper
Whisper's Chinese fine-tuned model has been converted to CT operator and all parameters have been deployed as an API interface. The model files are not included.
## fer_serving
Facial expression recognition. A pure CPU version that is fast and has high accuracy.
## funasr
Alibaba DAMO Academy has open-sourced an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. It is deployed as a unified and highly available model that can provide services by switching models through parameters.
## sadtalker
[SadTalker](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker)
